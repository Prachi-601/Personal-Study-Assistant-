# 🧠 AI-Powered Personal Study Assistant

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is aimed at helping students optimize their self-study sessions using intelligent automation. It’s designed to reduce the time spent on organizing notes and increase time spent on actual learning.

## 🚀 Planned Features
- ✨ AI-generated study summaries from uploaded notes and PDFs
- 🎯 Personalized learning suggestions based on progress and subjects
- 📊 Study progress tracking
- 📂 PDF and image upload support for digitizing handwritten notes
- 📝 In-app notes storage and easy access system
- ❓ Auto-generated quizzes from user notes
- 📅 Daily practice tests and revision scheduling

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Ideas
- **OCR:** Extract handwritten or printed content from images (e.g., Tesseract OCR)
- **AI/NLP:** Summarization models or APIs (like Hugging Face transformers or OpenAI)
- **Database:** Store user notes, quizzes, progress logs (e.g., SQLite or Firebase)
- **Backend:** Python with Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and basic JS (React optional for scalability)

## 💡 Why This Project?
As a student myself, I want to build something that feels like a study companion—one that’s smart, responsive, and supports a learner's goals. It's a blend of AI and empathy, focused on helping learners feel less overwhelmed and more in control.
